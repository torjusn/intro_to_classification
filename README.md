# Intro to Binary Classification on Horse Racing Data

# Description
This repo is meant to give a soft introduction to some important concepts and examples on applying Machine Learning towards predicting the outcome of horse races based on attributes connected to each horse. We will be using popular DS packages like scikit-learn and Pytorch for our models. This particular problem would be referred to as ´Binary Classification´ since the outcome for each horse can only be a win or loss which we can map to 0 or 1 for use in our models.

It is meant as a favor to a friend with a dataset and keen interest in ML but limited previous experience and is therefore likely best suited towards similar individuals with little to no background in ML.
