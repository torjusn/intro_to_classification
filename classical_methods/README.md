# Classical Methods
This section is the easier (but still powerful) part of classification using scikit-learn. Notice how few lines are needed in the `main.py` to train and evaluate a model on a binary classification task. While recommended to, the reader is not required to read up on or understand the models but simply instantiate them with e.g. `RandomForestClassifier()`. In general most sklearn classes does not require many (if at all) arguments but they should often be tweaked to boost performance if near an adequate solution.

## Prerequisites
- scikit-learn 1.1.1

## Usage
Run the following in terminal or conda prompt to train RF/LogReg models and output accuracy:
```
python main.py
```
