## MLP - Neural Net
While knowledge of the math behind a neural net would be preferred this isn't strictly needed to start a beginner Neural Net implementation as most modern high-level ML frameworks such as Pytorch provides functions doing it for us. It is however needed to have some understanding of the building blocks that makes up our network.

In short
